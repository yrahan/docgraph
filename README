usage
=====

Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:

1- Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2- Rename (move) the NAME module to be the name of your project 
   or whatever you want to call your root module.
3- Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.
4- Rename tests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.
5- Double check it's all working by using nosetests again.
	$ cd ..   # get out of tests/
	$ ls      # CORRECT! you are now in the right spot
	NAME            bin         docs        setup.py    tests
	$ nosetests
	.
